# Data-Structures-Project

Project Name: City Path Finder

-Description:
This project demonstrates finding the shortest path between cities using C++ and Dijkstra's algorithm. It includes basic implementations of graph representation and pathfinding.

-Technologies Used:
C++
Standard Template Library (STL)

-Instructions:
1-Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2-Run the executable to find the shortest path between cities.
3-Modify the dataset in main.cpp to include more cities and connections if needed.
